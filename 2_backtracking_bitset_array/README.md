# 2. Backtracking with array and bitset

This second implementation is significantly faster, mostly due to the overall higher performance of bitsets

## Criticalities
- The backtracking algorithm is probably not the most clever
- ??

## Performance
This implementation gets a big improvement from the previous one, taking around 2 seconds on the given [Sudoku.com Extremes](https://sudoku.com/it/extreme/).
