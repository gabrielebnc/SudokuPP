# 2. Backtracking with array and bitset

This second implementation is significantly faster, mostly due to the overall higher performance of bitsets

## Criticalities
- The backtracking algorithm is probably not the most clever
- Some puzzles are harder than others, and they can be made in a way specifically to be slow for the algorithm
- ??

## Performance (from benchmark execution)
