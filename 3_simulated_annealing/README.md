# Simulated Annealing

## Performance (from benchmark execution)

BTBitset results:
Executed Benchmark on 12 testing puzzles.
All results are correct. 
Average execution: 42.9167ms = 0.0429167s.
Standard deviation: 8.76982

Results correctness is not 100% guaranteed, there might be around a 0.7-1% chance of incorrect result.
This depends on the Simulated Annealing parameters (initial temperature, cooling rate and max iterations).

## Criticalities and Questions

- Can be more efficient?
- Not deterministic
- Can terminate with wrong result
