# 1. Naive Implementation with Backtracking

This first implementation uses basic logic and probably inefficient data types to simply set the bottom line.
## Criticalities
- `std::vector`
- `std::set`
- Some puzzles are harder than others, and they can be made in a way specifically to be slow for the algorithm
- ??

## Performance (from benchmark execution)
Naive results:\
Executed Benchmark on 7 testing puzzles.\
All results are correct.\
Average execution: 7155.29ms = 7.15529s.\
Standard deviation: 9218.28
