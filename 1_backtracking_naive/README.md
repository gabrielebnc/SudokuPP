# 1. Naive Implementation with Backtracking

This first implementation uses basic logic and probably inefficient data types to simply set the bottom line.
## Criticalities
- `std::vector`
- `std::set`
- ?

## Performance
Naive results:
Executed Benchmark on 7 testing puzzles.
Average execution: 7155.29ms = 7.15529s.
Standard deviation: 9218.28
