# 1. Naive Implementation with Backtracking

This first implementation uses basic logic and probably inefficient data types to simply set the bottom line.
## Criticalities
- `std::vector`
- `std::set`
- ?

## Performance
This implementation is quite slow on [Sudoku.com Extremes](https://sudoku.com/it/extreme/), the sudoku in the code
around **28 seconds** to complete.
